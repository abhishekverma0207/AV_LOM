Execution of Aditya's model
============================
Execute following notebooks
Note: train.csv and test.csv should be present in folder name "input". Output files will be genrated at current path
1. user_cluster-kmeans.ipynb, this will generate file user_cluster1.csv in input folder
2. xgb_2fold-cv3_bag3_nt70_scalepos1_best_tree.ipynb, this will generate test prediction file name "xgb_2fold-cv2_bag3_nt70_scalepos1_nt70.csv".
3. lgb_5fold-5_bag_nt45_rank_average_AND_lgb_5fold-5_bag_nt45_rank_average_4f.ipynb, this will generate test prediction file names "lgb_5fold-5_bag_nt45_rank_average.csv" and "lgb_5fold-5_bag_nt45_rank_average_4f.csv".
4. lgb_5fold-5_bag_nt55_rank_average_5f_AND_lgb_5fold-5_bag_nt55_rank_average_4f.ipynb, this will generate test prediction file names "lgb_5fold-5_bag_nt55_rank_average_5f.csv" and "lgb_5fold-5_bag_nt55_rank_average_4f.csv".
5. lgb_new_features-v6-5fold_5bag_cv_retry_lb_692_ens6941-submitted, this will generate lgb_5fold-5_bag_nt55_rank_average.csv.
